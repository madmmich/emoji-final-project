Ling-144 Final Project on brand emoji usage

This repository includes the files used for skimming from each brand, which will eventually be merged into one for ease of reading. Currently, working through each brand has worked the best.

The method used for skimming was **snscrape** and for filtering the tweets to contain only emoji's was **emoji** and **regex**.

The files include:

1. **sncrape-code-tinder.py**, a python that contains the code used to scrape tweets from the user "tinder"
2. **user-tweets-tinder.csv**, a csv that contains the initial scrape of 100 tweets from the tinder webpage that was then filtered
3. **filter-code-tinder.py**, which contains the code used to filter the tweets to keep only ones with emoji's
4. **skimmed-tweets-tinder.csv**, conatins the file of filtered tweets
